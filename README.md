# Simulation-of-Double-Pendulum-in-a-chaotic-system-in-MATLAB
A double pendulum is a simple physical system that demonstrates chaos theory. It consists of two pendulums connected end to end, with a bar swinging from a pivot and a second pendulum attached to the end of the bar. A double pendulum executes simple harmonic motion when displacements from equilibrium are small. However, when large displacements are imposed, the non-linear system becomes dramatically chaotic in its motion and demonstrates that deterministic systems are not necessarily predictable. In this simulation, I have tried to show the system's nonlinearity and how it leads to a chaotic system. This is a fascinating phenomenon in physical science.
